##### Contains DockerHub repos for different versions of standard official open source software, see 

These docker images are tested by hundreds of tools and also used in the full functional test suites of various other GitHub repos.

See also the [Kubernetes templates](https://github.com/HariSekhon/Kubernetes-templates) repo.

Overview - this repo contains:

* **Hadoop & Big Data** ecosystem technologies (Spark, wip...)

* [My GitHub repos](https://github.com/mrdaggubati) expected to grow with many tools and scripts related to above  listed
technologies with their dependencies as docker images and example deployment files as  docker stack / k8s 

These images are all available pre-built on [My DockerHub - https://hub.docker.com/u/mrdaggubati/](https://hub.docker.com/u/mrdaggubati/).

**Quality and Testing** - this repo should be having reusable tools, test suites & operation mgmt scripts etc...

[Continuous Integration] -- WIP
